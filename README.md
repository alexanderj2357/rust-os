# rust-os

An implementation of a basic operating system entirly in Rust from the grounds up, running on top of the Raspberry Pi 3 B+. We implemented the following components:

- [x] bootloader
- [x] stack allocator
- [x] XMODEM file transfer protocol
- [x] timer
- [ ] shell
- [ ] heap allocator
- [ ] sd driver
- [ ] FAT32 file system
- [ ] processes
- [ ] multithreading

We did this as a side project for the purpose of gaining a deeper understanding into the inner workings of operating systems and to reach an intermediate level of competency in the Rust programming language.

We used [Stanford CS140e](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140e/) to guide us in this project.
